NAME: P.Vishnu Prakash

INTERN ID: CT04DH1031

DOMAIN: DATA SCIENCE

DURATION: 4 WEEEKS

MENTOR: NEELA SANTOSH


This project demonstrates a complete data science workflow:

1. Data Collection: Fetches the Iris dataset from an online source.
2. Preprocessing: Cleans and encodes the data, splits it into training and test sets.
3. Model Training: Trains a Random Forest classifier on the processed data.
4. Deployment: Deploys the model using FastAPI, exposing an HTTP endpoint for real-time predictions.

**Deliverable:** A working API for flower species prediction, showcasing an end-to-end machine learning pipeline from data to deployment.
